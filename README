ISPView aims to make useful inferences about the topology of autonomous systems by analyzing BGP path advertisements known to IXPs.
Double - click on the executable JAR file to launch the application. The database file 'COP.h2.db' should be in the same directory as
the JAR. 
The application has a tabbed panel:
1. ISP Graphs (Run a Query Panel)
	This panel lets you visualize paths for a ISP in a region by analyzing sent/received BGP Path advertisements. You can interact with the 
	graph and save a copy.
2. Data Management (Tools Panel)
	The second panel lets you update the database by querying looking glass server for the latest data. You could also choose to discard older 
	versions of your data.
3. Paths Panel
	This panel lets ypu draw shortest paths between a source IP network and a destination IP network. You can also query for the mapping between 
	Autonomous System and IP - networks.
	
You can save any of the graphs by clicking on the Capture button. A screenshot of the graphs is saved in the same directory as the JAR file.
